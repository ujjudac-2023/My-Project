**Introduction**

"Our thoughts become our Reality."

Great line, isn't it? Well, Yes! It is. But now the question is, what we think?

Answer to it is very simple; we think what we see around us the most of our times, the things that influence us, the things which subconsciously put their imprints on our brain and personality. So, it implies that we become what we watch. Therefore, what we watch becomes the most important aspect of our lives because it is directly or in directly deciding our character and our personality. Drawing the attention from these thoughts we realized that consuming good media is very crucial.

This Website helps user to choose what he wants to watch or where wants to invest his good 2 hours of time.

This website is created from scratch of very core and basic concepts of web development.

That is using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

The Website is created by Modular approach.

** Problem Domain**

Consuming good entertainment is very impotant.

But when we look around we notice the culture of trending cringe content.

Now here comes the main problem, we have limited time for entertainment and we have to invest it wisely so that it can be productive as well.

But what to watch becomes a major problem, there are lots of content, movies, series or anime are already present.

Problem is deciding what is worth our time and what is not?

**Solution Domain**

The little contribution towards the solution of this problem is CLIP.

Here, from all the movie suggestions that user might have collected, he can just search them in CLIP.

CLIP searches the keywords enter entered by user in its API database and returns the suitable results.

The result are a brief overview about the movie that has been searched along with their IMdB ratings.

From here user can decide whether that particular movie is from his interests or not.
